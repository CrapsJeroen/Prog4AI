\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
% WHY
The goal of this project is to design an architecture for a smart home system.
Smart home systems provide home automation, which is the use and control of home appliances remotely or automatically. 
This system improves convenience, comfort, energy efficiency and security for the user.
% WHAT
The system consists of a smart home gateway and an online system.
The smart home gateway can communicate with plug-and-play sensors and actuators, which are spread around the home of the user.
The online system will communicate with the gateway to make sure that any information is synchronized and properly processed.

% HOW
The points of differentiation from existing technology providers will be twofold. Firstly, as the HomeSys gateway will feature a 3G communication module, it will will be 100\% plug-and-play, i.e. not requiring any pre-existing infrastructure. Secondly, the gateway will be designed with explicit focus on flexibility, hereby allowing the development and integration of new smart-home end-to-end applications, perhaps even allowing third party applications.
